Lucy's Neighbours 
Medium Accuracy: 100.0% Submissions: 425 Points: 4
Lucy lives in house number X. She has a list of N house numbers in the society. Distance between houses can be determined by studying the difference between house numbers. Help her find out K closest neighbors.
Note: If two houses are equidistant and Lucy has to pick only one, the house with the smaller house number is given preference.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, X = 0, K = 4
a[] = {-21, 21, 4, -12, 20}, 
Output:
-21 -12 4 20
Explanation:
The closest neighbour is house
number 4. Followed by -12 and 20. -21 and 21 
are both equal distance from X=0. Therefore, 
Lucy can only pick 1. Based on the given 
condition she picks -21 as it is the smaller 
of the two. 
Example 2:

Input:
N = 6, X = 5, K = 3 
a[] = {10, 2, 14, 4, 7, 6},
Output:
4 6 7 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function  Kclosest() which takes the array arr[], size of array N, X, and K as input parameters, and returns the list of numbers in sorted order.

Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105 
-104 ≤ X, arr[i] ≤ 104
